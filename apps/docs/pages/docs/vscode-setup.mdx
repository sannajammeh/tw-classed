The Tailwind CSS Intellisense extension struggles with providing auto-competion and css intellisense when used inside the `classed` method. However, Tailwind CSS has a solution for this.

## Setting Experimental Class Regex

By adding this script to your `settings.json` in the workspace or globally, you can set the regex for the `classed` method to match the class names and provide intellisense.

```json
{
  // ... settings
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["tailwind|classed\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
  ]
}
```

Tailwind CSS Intellisense will now match the class names and provide intellisense for the `classed` method.
