## Importing types

You can import all types at once:

```typescript
import type * as Classed from "@tw-classed/react";
```

These include:

- `Classed.ClassedComponent`
- `Classed.InferVariantProps`
- `Classed.VariantProps`

## Extract variants from a component

```typescript
import type * as Classed from "@tw-classed/react";

const Button = classed("button", "px-2 py-1", {
  variants: {
    color: {
      blue: "bg-blue-500",
      red: "bg-red-500",
    },
  },
});

type ButtonVariants = Classed.VariantProps<typeof Button>;
// {
//     color: "blue" | "red";
// }
```
